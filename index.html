                <p>American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that uses hand shapes, movements, facial expressions, and body language to convey meaning. It's primarily used by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities in the United States and parts of Canada. ASL has its own unique grammar, syntax, and structure, distinct from spoken English, and it is not just a visual representation of English but a language in its own right. ASL is part of a larger family of sign languages around the world, each of which developed independently, much like spoken languages.</p>
